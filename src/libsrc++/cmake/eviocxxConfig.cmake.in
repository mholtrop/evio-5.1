# eviocxxConfig.cmake file -- For building against the EVIO C++ libraries.
#
# Note 1: The EVIO C++ libraries are very poorly maintained.
# Note 2: This sets up a Modern CMake package which puts all the information
# in a *target*.
# To build against this, you only need to do "find_package(eviocxx REQUIRED)"
# and then "target_link_libraries(mytarg PUBLIC eviocxx)"
# This will link against the library and it will *also*
# include the includes directories automatically.
#
# Note 3: To link against the static version use eviocxx_static.
