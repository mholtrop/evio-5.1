# evioConfig.cmake file -- For building against the EVIO C libraries.
#
# Note: This sets up a Modern CMake package which puts all the information
# in a *target*.
# To build against this, you only need to do "find_package(evio REQUIRED)"
# and then "target_link_libraries(mytarg PUBLIC evio)"
# This will link against the library and it will *also*
# include the includes directories automatically.
#
# Note 2: To link against the static version use evio_static.
